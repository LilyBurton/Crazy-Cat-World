        <td><p>Hello Friends!<br>My name is Lily and I am running my first ever website which is to show my love and knowledge of our feline friends that has been around to show mystery, entertainment and love for generations.
              <br>All through my life I have lived with cats where I come from a family where you can't call a house a home without a cat where I have many funny stories which I am sure you guys have as well.
              <br>Not only can you follow news,stories and learn different things about cats, but also be able to share your own stories about your funny feline friends that will bring the community together.
              <br>We can also help each other by looking out for any missing cats. Just post a missing cat notice with it's name, description and name of the local area where we can help you find your missing cat and have them go back to their homes. <br>
